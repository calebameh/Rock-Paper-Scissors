<h1 align="center">Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h1>

  <p align="center">
    Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. This is a replication of the game using Python.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Rock beats Scissors</br>
Paper beats Rock</br>
Scissors beats Paper</br>

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats.

This is a simple version of this game with Python. One player is controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player).
